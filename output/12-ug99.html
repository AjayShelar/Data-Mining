            <strong>see if you can identify the pest</strong>
            <p>Everyone  needs to keep an eye out for stem rust symptoms of Ug99.Stem rust is characterised by reddish brown, powdery oblong  pustules on stems as well as leaves, leaf sheaths and heads.There are other wheat rust diseases that have similar  symptoms to Ug99. These include: leaf rust (Puccinia  triticina) which causes small brown circular pustules that are normally on  the upper leaf surface, but can also be on the wheat sheath in severe epidemics;  and stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici) characterised by long stripes  of small yellowish orange pustules on the leaves.In Australia if stem rust is detected on any wheat lines  that were thought to be resistant to wheat stem rust, they need to be tested  for Ug99.The ability of rust plant pathogens to spread rapidly  makes these pests extremely difficult to eradicate. Rust spores can spread  large distances with wind and human-assisted movement of infected plant material  and contaminated clothing.Pathotype Ug99 of stem wheat rust is a production pest and will  also affect leaves and grain.If you work around imported goods, you need to look for grain that is  infected with reddish brown, powdery pustules. Also ensure that all  imported agricultural machinery is clean and free of wheat seeds and other  contaminants.It is important that growers monitor their crops regularly  to ensure early detection, especially during warm spring conditions.Walking through cropping paddocks in a ‘W’ shape  checking 5 plants at 10 different locations can help with early detection. Try  to keep checking every 7-10 days. Every stage of growth should be monitored!Protect your farm  from biosecurity risks, practice good on-farm biosecurity and  regularly monitor your fields.</p>

            <strong>Check what can legally come into australia</strong>
            <p>All Australians and international tourists have a role to  keep out exotic pests and diseases.Australia remains free of this exotic pest. We  need your help to keep it this way.Check what you can and cannot bring into Australia, whether  you are a:Australia has a well-deserved reputation for  marketing quality wheat to the world. This favorable status depends on good  biosecurity practices, including growers and grain handlers inspecting their  wheat, and taking action if they see any problems.Some items, by law, are subject to certain import conditions  to be allowed into Australia. Please check the         Biosecurity  Import Condition System (BICON).Be  aware of any Ug99 biosecurity measures that may be in  place for incoming goods and conveyances.         Industry advice  notices are reviewed regularly and could change.</p>

            <strong>secure any suspect specimens</strong>
            <p>Containment  is critical.If  you suspect you have seen Ug99 in cereal crops, take a photo and record  the location.</p>
