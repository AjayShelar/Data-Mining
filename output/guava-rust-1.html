            <strong>see if you can identify the pest</strong>
            <p>Everyone  needs to keep an eye out for guava rust. Key symptoms are lesions forming on leaves and containing yellow  spores.Guava rust can spread easily over long distances through the  movement of:Guava rustattacks young, soft, actively-growing  leaves, shoot tips and young stems. Fruit and flower parts are also susceptible.  The first signs of infection are tiny pustules usually on young leaves. After a  few days, the pustules erupt with the production of distinctive, yellow spores.  The infected area spreads and multiple pustules eventually merge. Left  untreated, the disease can cause deformed leaves, heavy defoliation of  branches, dieback, stunted growth and even plant death.If guava rust became established in Australia,  it could have a significant impact on eucalypt plantations, native forests and  urban flora with indirect impacts on native fauna and human lifestyles.Illegal  importation of infected plant material poses the greatest risk for the disease  to enter Australia. If you work around imported plant material, including cut  flowers and nursery stock you need to look for disease symptoms.Early detection of guava rust is the best way to reduce the  spread, if it were to establish in Australia.Be vigilant and look for any signs or symptoms in:</p>

            <strong>Check what can legally come into australia</strong>
            <p>All  Australians and international tourists have a role to keep out exotic pests and  diseases.Australia  remains free of this exotic disease. We need your help to keep it this way.Check what you can and cannot bring into Australia, whether  you are a:Guava rust and myrtle rust combined would have serious combined  impact on our eucalyptus trees if Guava rust were to enter Australia. We do not  want to further endanger our iconic eucalyptus species through introduction of  this pathogen.Some items, by law, are subject to certain import conditions  to be allowed into Australia. Please check the          Biosecurity  Import Condition System (BICON).Be  aware of any guava rust biosecurity measures that may be in  place for incoming goods and conveyances.          Industry advice  notices are reviewed regularly and could change.</p>

            <strong>secure any suspect specimens</strong>
            <p>Containment  is critical.In as little of 10 days the fungus can produce thousands of  spores. Spores can spread very easily through the movement of infected plant  material, clothing, equipment and wind.It is important to not move samples to reduce the risk of  spread. Take a photo, record the location and get it checked by an expert.</p>
