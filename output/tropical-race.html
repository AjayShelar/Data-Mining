            <p>Everyone  needs to keep an eye out for Panama disease Tropical Race 4.The first symptoms are usually the yellowing of lower or  older leaves. This yellowing progresses towards the centre of the leaf and the  leaf edges then turn brown before dying. As the lower leaves die they wilt and  collapse, forming a ‘skirt’ around the plant. The younger leaves may remain  green and upright. The stem’s internal tissue discolours from yellow to red,  through to dark brown or black, depending on how long the plant has been  infected. The fruit of an infected banana plant is not affected by the fungus,  and is still safe for human consumption.Dead plants leave behind spores that can live in soil for  decades and will infect any future banana crop plantings. When the fungus  blocks the water conducting tissue within the banana stem, it starves the plant  of water causing it to wilt and eventually die.The symptoms of          Fusarium oxysporum f. sp.          cubense Tropical Race 4 may be confused with those of nutritional problems, water  stress, bacterial corm rot, and other diseases, which is why proper diagnosis  is important.Illegal  importation of infected plant material poses the greatest risk for the disease  to enter Australia. If you work around imported plant material, including cut  flowers and nursery stock you need to look for disease symptoms.Ensure your shoes and clothes are free of soil if you have  visited agricultural areas before entering Australia. If you work on farms,  tell the farm owners where you have been recently to avoid cross-contamination.Keep a watch for sick banana plants in your area. Yellowed  and wilting leaves, browned leaf edges, dead leaves and splitting stems are potential  signs of the disease.Ensure that you do not move soil or plant material to and  from areas with banana plants.</p>
