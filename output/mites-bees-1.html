            <p>Everyone needs to keep an eye out for mites of bees and  their symptoms on bees.Internal and external bee mites pose a high biosecurity risk  to Australia because of their effect on European honey bee hives and the  subsequent effect on pollination-dependent  plant industries.Tracheal mites (Acarapis woodi) are internal,  microscopic parasites in the honey bee respiratory system and feed on the bee’s  blood. They spend their whole life inside adult honey bees, except for mature  females, which leave the host to attach to younger honey bees through bee to  bee contact.Tropilaelaps mites (Tropilaelaps clareae and          Tropilaelaps  mercedesae) are active, tiny external parasites that feed on the blood  of drone and worker bee pupae. Adult mites lay eggs in the brood cells of honey  bee larvae and feed on developing honey bees.Varroa mites (Varroa destructor and          Varroa  jacobosoni) are small red-brown external parasites of adult honey bees,  and drone and worker bee brood. Varroa mites feed and reproduce on larvae and  pupae, causing deformities and weakening of honey bees as well as transmitting  numerous viruses.If you work around imported goods you need to look for swarms  of bees or bees and their hives attached to:All beekeepers, from commercial operators, backyard  enthusiasts, to people starting up their first hives, form part of the honey  bee industry. Each and every beekeeper has a role to play in protecting honey  bees from exotic pests.Keep an eye on the health of your bees. Every beekeeper  should be familiar with established pests, the symptoms they cause and how to  control them. Beekeepers should also be aware of threats posed by exotic pests,  and how to monitor hives and apiaries for their possible presence.BeeAware has  resources to help you manage your hives.</p>

            <strong>Check what can legally come into australia</strong>
            <p>All Australians and international tourists have a role to  keep out exotic pests and diseases.Bee mites are widespread around the world. Australia remains  free of these exotic pests. We need your help to keep it this way.Check what you can and cannot bring into Australia, whether  you are a:Bee mites are transported on bees, and could be introduced  into Australia on exotic bees such as Africanised, Asian, Cape, dwarf or giant  honey bees, as well as exotic European honey bees. These bees can hitchhike to  Australia on many pathways such as goods, conveyances or personal effects.Bee mites can spread via numerous pathways, including:Varroa  mites have also been observed on other flower feeding insects, such as:This indicates they may be  able to spread short distances on such insects.Some items, by law, are subject to certain import conditions  to be allowed into Australia. Please check the          Biosecurity  Import Condition System (BICON).Be aware of any relevant biosecurity measures that may be in place for incoming goods and  conveyances.          Industry  advice notices are reviewed regularly and could change.</p>

            <strong>secure any suspect specimens</strong>
            <p>Containment is crucial. If you suspect you’ve seen a mite or  symptoms of mites in your hive, take a photo and secure the bees in the hive.Gardeners can keep an eye out for bees that do not look  healthy or appear to be carrying round brown discs on their body.</p>
