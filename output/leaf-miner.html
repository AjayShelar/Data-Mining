            <strong>see if you can identify the pest</strong>
            <p>Adult leaf miners are small, greyish black flies. They have a yellow and black body and are 1.3-2.3mm in length. The different species vary in colour which makes them identifiable. Adult females are larger than males and more robust.The larval stage of the leaf miner is not usually seen as they remain inside the leaf tissue. Egg laying punctures can be seen as white speckles on leaves. The feeding track is white, often with an obvious trail of dark waste material inside. Damage caused by the leaf miner reduces the growth and development of seedlings and young plants which can lead to death.Leaf miners can spread quite easily either by flying, wind dispersal or through the movement of infested plants soil or packaging.If you work around imported goods you need to look for leaf miners or the damage they cause to leaves.The host range for the different species is quite broad:Keep a look out in your vegetable garden for these pests.</p>
