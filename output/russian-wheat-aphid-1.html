            <p>Everyone  needs to keep an eye out for Russian wheat aphid.Russian wheat aphid may occur on contaminated plant  material, on machinery and other equipment. Adults and nymphs do not survive  long without access to living plants. As a result, eggs are a more likely way  for the aphid to enter Australia. In addition to human assisted spread, dispersal  of winged adults can occur over large distances by wind-assisted flight.This aphid is yellow-green to grey-green, spindle-shaped and  about 2mm long as an adult. Although its surface is smooth just after moulting,  it soon becomes covered with a waxy white exudate. It has a double tail at the tip of the abdomen,  a feature that distinguishes it from all other cereal aphid species.This aphid causes characteristic damage: white to  purple streaking and leaf-rolling on wheat and barley leaves. Large colonies of  aphids can roll the flag leaf to the point where the tip of the wheat head  becomes trapped, giving it a fish-hook shape.If you work around imported goods you need to look for  Russian wheat aphid on:Many types of aphids are present in Australia, however no  other cereal aphid has the  characteristic double tail. Colonies are found most frequently on the  youngest leaves or on newly emerged flowers/seed heads. Rolling ranges in  severity from simple folding of the leaf along the mid-vein, to one side of the  leaf rolled in upon itself, to the whole leaf being tightly rolled around the  aphid colony.Young plants are often stunted and even killed. Plants  attacked after flowering show few or no obvious symptoms.Grain growers are advised by the Russian Wheat  Aphid National Technical Group to monitor their crops for infestations of the  newly introduced Russian wheat aphid and to report suspected infestations but  to hold off spraying wherever possible until spring.Protect your farm  from biosecurity risks, practice good on-farm biosecurity and  regularly monitor your crops.

            <p>All Australians and international tourists have a role to  keep out exotic pests and diseases.Check what you can and cannot bring into Australia, whether  you are a:The Russian wheat aphid is widespread in grain growing  regions of the world. Australia remains free of the holocyclic form which  produces males and females. It is important to prevent this form from establishing  in Australia, as it will allow the aphid to overwinter as eggs.Some items, by law, are subject to certain import conditions  to be allowed into Australia. Please check the         Biosecurity  Import Condition System (BICON).Be  aware of any Russian wheat aphid biosecurity measures that may be in  place for incoming goods and conveyances.         Industry advice  notices are reviewed regularly and could change.</p>

            <strong>secure any suspect specimens</strong>
            <p>Containment  is critical. This could be as easy as bagging a suspect plant specimen  that has symptoms or stopping an insect escaping by closing the doors on a  shipping container.</p>
