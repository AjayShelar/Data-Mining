            <p>Everyone needs to keep an eye out for phytophthora species.Phytophthoraspecies are oomycetes (water moulds) which look similar to fungi but their cell walls contain cellulose rather than chitin as is found in cell walls of the true Fungi. They require a moist environment (abundant water in soil or on foliage) to actively grow and reproduce.Phytophthora ramorum causes two distinct sets of symptoms, depending on the host species. On some hosts the pathogen causes trunk cankers that usually form on the lower trunk and result in brown or black discoloured outer bark and bleeding sap. These cankers can lead to death of the tree. On other hosts, including many horticultural nursery crops, the pathogen causes a foliar blight and shoot dieback. In shrubs, leaf blight symptoms appear as dark brown spots or blotches usually occurring at the leaf tip. Eventually the leaves completely turn brown to black and then may drop prematurely. Twig blight/dieback results in shoots becoming blackened with or without foliage attached.Phytophthora kernoviae has similar symptoms to          P. ramorum causing dieback and bleeding cankers. Infected shoots and leaves of plants begin to die when the plant becomes infected showing blackening down the mid-vein.Airborne phytophthora – a) Shoot dieback of          Rhododendron infected with          Phytophthora ramorum (image courtesy Everett Hansen, Oregon State University) b) underside & c) top of leaves infected with          Phytophthora ramorum (images Bruce Moltzen, Missouri Dept. of Conservation)SOURCE:          http://pbt.padil.gov.au/pbt/index.php?q=node/13&pbtID=119 Close up image of plant showing the beginnings of shoot dieback with stems started to brown and blacken towards the tip of the leaf.

Wet, cooler periods of the year support the growth of the pathogen.Phytophthoraspecies are capable of natural spread and through human activities. This pathogen can spread via wind and rain as well as through the movement of infected clothing and shoes, equipment, plants and green compost.          Phytophthora ramorum has also been found in waterways.If you work around imported goods you need to look for symptoms of phytophthora on plant materials.           The pathogen can also spread via human assisted movement of infected clothing and shoes. It is important that people ensure that shoes and clothes are clean and free of soil or plant material when entering Australia.Check your production nursery frequently for the presence of new pests and unusual symptoms. Take action if you see symptoms of phytophthora on shrubs or trees.           If          Phytophthora ramorum was to establish in Australia it would have an impact on:</p>

            <p>All Australians and international tourists have a role to keep out exotic pests and diseases. Xylella is present in a number of countries.Australia remains free of this exotic pest. We need your help to keep it this way.Check what you can and cannot bring into Australia, whether you are a:Let’s protect our nursery stock and native species that could be affected by these invasive pathogen.Some items, by law, are subject to certain import conditions to be allowed into Australia.

            <strong>secure any suspect specimens</strong>
            <p>Containment is critical.It is important to not move samples to reduce the risk of spread. Take a photo, record the location and get it checked by an expert.</p>
